        return an integer which is the distance

          Hint:
      This approach uses dynamic programming. Key idea is if we compute the distance 
      between the prefix of the first string and the prefix of the second string, 
      find the distance between the two full strings using the distance between the last
      computed prefix values. Store the distances in a matrix to incrementally
      solve the problem, one character at a time.

      You are free to use other approaches to the problem.
      Pseudocode:
      Create a 2D distance table with:
        rows = length of str1 +1
        col = length of str2 +1

      for i goes from 1 to number of rows in table:
        for j goes from 1 to number of col in table:
          1. Compute delete_cost

          2. Compute insertion_cost

          3. Compute substitute_cost

          Store minimum of the 3 costs at the table[i][j] location.
